An example of how to construct `main` function using LLVM C++ API 
Make sure you have the LLVM development libraries installed and compile the program with the appropriate flags to link against the LLVM libraries:
`g++ main.cpp llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core -o main`

This will produce an executable named `main`. When you run it, it will print the LLVM bitcode representing the created module to the standard output. You can redirect the output to a file if you want to save the bitcode.

An example of how the `main` function looks like is in `llvm_main.ll`.
In LLVM IR, the main function is defined using the define keyword followed by the return type and function name. The function body is enclosed within curly braces. In this example, the main function has a return type of i32 (32-bit integer) and takes no arguments.

The function body consists of a single basic block named entry. The ret instruction is used to return a value from the function. In this case, it returns an i32 value of 0, indicating successful execution.

Keep in mind that LLVM IR is a low-level representation and is not meant to be directly written or edited by hand. Instead, it's generated by compilers or other tools targeting LLVM.
