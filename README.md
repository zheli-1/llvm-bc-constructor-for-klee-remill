For `llvm_bc_construction.cpp`:

An example of how to construct `main` function using LLVM C++ API 
Make sure you have the LLVM development libraries installed and compile the program with the appropriate flags to link against the LLVM libraries:
`g++ main.cpp llvm-config --cxxflags --ldflags --system-libs --libs core -o main`

This will produce an executable named `main`. When you run it, it will print the LLVM bitcode representing the created module to the standard output. You can redirect the output to a file if you want to save the bitcode.

An example of how the `main` function looks like is in `llvm_main.ll`.
In LLVM IR, the main function is defined using the define keyword followed by the return type and function name. The function body is enclosed within curly braces. In this example, the main function has a return type of i32 (32-bit integer) and takes no arguments.

The function body consists of a single basic block named entry. The ret instruction is used to return a value from the function. In this case, it returns an i32 value of 0, indicating successful execution.

Keep in mind that LLVM IR is a low-level representation and is not meant to be directly written or edited by hand. Instead, it's generated by compilers or other tools targeting LLVM.

For `add_basic_blocks.cpp`:

To call other LLVM basic blocks within the main function, you can create additional basic blocks and use branch instructions to transfer control flow between them. `add_basic_blocks.cpp` shows how you can modify the previous main function to include multiple basic blocks.

In this modified example, two additional basic `blocks` (`block1` and `block2`) are created. After the initial entry block, the control flow branches from entry to `block1` using the CreateBr instruction.

In `block1`, some computations are performed using the IR builder (builder). In this case, we're adding two constant integers. After the computations, the control flow branches from `block1` to `block2`.

In `block2`, the result of the computations is returned using the CreateRet instruction. Finally, the module is verified, and the LLVM bitcode is printed to the standard output.

When you run this code, you'll see the updated LLVM IR code that includes multiple basic blocks and control flow between them.
